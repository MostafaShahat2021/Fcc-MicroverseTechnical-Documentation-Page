      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
        Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
        environment to provide programmatic control over them

      </p>
      <code>if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
        statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
        statement_last; }</code>
      <p> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
        elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
        purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
          server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
          continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on
          a server. </li>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
          Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form
          and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. </li>
      </ul>

        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
        resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java
        expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
        from LiveScript to JavaScript.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
          page about JavaScript. </li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li> A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW). </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
        system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
        prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
        provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
        supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
        executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
      <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
        "otherValue";</code>

    <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
      <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
      <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
        conform to certain rules.</p>
      <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can
        also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
        (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");</code>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
      <header>Hello world</header>

      <p> The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
        omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.</p>
      <p> <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
        WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
        //statements } </code></p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to
        any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local
        variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
      <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
        specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
        you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
        not defined</code>
      <ul>Six data types that are primitives:
        <li> Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable. </li>
        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
        <li> undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined. </li>
        <li> null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same
          as Null, NULL, or any other variant. </li>
        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>and Object</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
